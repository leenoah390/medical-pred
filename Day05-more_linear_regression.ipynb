    "# Day 05: More Linear Regression\n",
    "Review of last time:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear regression is about creating a linear model to predict Y along variable(s) X\n",
    "    * Involves getting estimates for coefficients Bn\n",
    "    * Model is evaluated by residuals e\n",
    "* Standard Error (SE) is the variance of Bn\n",
    "* 95% Confidence Interval = Bn ± 2(SE)\n",
    "* Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "    * Prove the null hypothesis (Y can not be explained by X) is wrong\n",
    "    * Use result of P-value to reject or not, based on value of 0.05\n",
    "* Smaller p-value means stronger relationship, larger p-value means that random chance is more likeley\n",
    "* RSE measure lack of fit (smaller is better)\n",
    "* R Squared measures how much of the data can be explained by regression\n",
    "    * 1 = all data can be explained\n",
    "    * 0 = no data can be explained\n",
    "* R Squared = RSS/TSS\n",
    "    * RSS (Residual Sum of Squares) = SUM of Residuals (difference between actual and predicted y)\n",
    "    * TSS (Total Sum of Squares) = SUM of Variation (difference between actual and mean of y)"
