    "# Day 04: Multi Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear regression using multiple variables - as opposed to just one - is **multiple linear regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we get into that, let's look at some ways to evaluate a model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Methods\n",
    "In addition to MSE, another way to evaluate a model's performance is the model's RSS (Residual Sum of Squares). It is the sum of squared residuals (errors). We must aim to minimize RSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between MSE and RSS is:\\\n",
    "MSE = RSS / # of observances\n",
